# NetworkModeling_RareCellVariability_Code
Code corresponding to paper 'Gene networks with transcriptional bursting recapitulate rare transient coordinated high expression states in cancer'

We provide the code use to create the figures and analysis correspinding to paper 'Gene networks with transcriptional bursting recapitulate rare transient coordinated high expression states in cancer'.

Any of the figure panels may be recreated according to the corresponding scripts in /Scripts/Figures.
For importing data from https://www.dropbox.com/work/shared_yogesh/rareCellNetwork/Data_public we created impriting script sin folder /Scripts/Import. 

In the seperate files /Scripts/mainAnalysis and /Scripts/suppAnalysis you can find an example simulation and anaylsis for two-node network. As the simulation and analysis was computationally time-consuming this small example should help in understanding the main steps of the paper. 

the folder /functions summarizes all functions necessary to perform the analysis or creation of figures.
