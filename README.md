# NetworkModeling_RareCellVariability_Code
Code corresponding to paper 'Gene networks with transcriptional bursting recapitulate rare transient coordinated high expression states in cancer'.

Here, you can find the code to (1) run an example analysis and (2) recreate figures.

Any of the figure panels may be recreated according to the corresponding scripts in /Scripts/Figures.
For importing data from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n94q45zkn5w54fe/AACC3cgts4kD6MWEE452pEgEa?dl=0 we created importing scripts in folder /Scripts/Import. 

In the seperate files /Scripts/mainAnalysis and /Scripts/suppAnalysis you can find an example simulation and anaylsis for a particular two-node network. As the simulation and analysis was computationally time-consuming this small example should help in understanding the main steps of the paper. 

The folder /Functions summarizes all functions necessary to perform the analysis or creation of figures. 

Further data, figures and outputs of the example analysis can be found via
